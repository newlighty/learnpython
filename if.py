# ues number
# valet = int(input("enter the value"))

# if valet > 100 :
#     print(" your are good customer ")

# hear you must convert variable from string to int so we use int or we get error

# using else

# valet = int(input("enter the value"))

# if valet > 100 :

#      print(" your are good customer ")

# else:
#     print("this your lukey day")

# using boolean =========

#  hear if you enter less 100 you get error that value is not defined because  it is boolean and only if it's true  it work

# if valet > 100 :
#     value = True

# if value :

#      print(" your are good customer ")


# so to solve problem hear we first declare variable as true and than if meet conditions it change to True


# value = False

# valet = int(input("enter the value"))

# if valet > 100 :
#     value = True

# if value :

#      print(" your are good customer ")

# else :
#     print("you money is not enough!")
