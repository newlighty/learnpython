# ues number
# valet = int(input("enter the value"))

# if valet > 100 :
#     print(" your are good customer ")

# hear you must convert variable from string to int so we use int or we get error

# using else

# valet = int(input("enter the value"))

# if valet > 100 :

#      print(" your are good customer ")

# else:
#     print("this your lukey day")

# using boolean =========

#  hear if you enter less 100 you get error that value is not defined because  it is boolean and only if it's true  it work

# if valet > 100 :
#     value = True

# if value :

#      print(" your are good customer ")


# so to solve problem hear we first declare variable as true and than if meet conditions it change to True


# value = False

# valet = int(input("enter the value"))

# if valet > 100 :
#     value = True

# if value :

#      print(" your are good customer ")

# else :
#     print("you money is not enough!")


# hear is challenge  if you want to calculate shipping for user

# shipping = False

# total = int(input("Enter total purchase: "))

# if total < 50:
#     total += 10
#     shipping = True

# print("Total: $" + str(total))
# if shipping:
#     print("Shipping: $10")
# else:
#     print("Shipping: Free")
# ```

# Here's how this code works:

# 1. We start by setting the `shipping` variable to `False`.

# 2. We prompt the user to enter the total purchase amount using the `input()` function and convert the input to an integer using the `int()` function.

# 3. We check if the total purchase amount is less than 50. If it is, we add 10 to the total and set the `shipping` variable to `True`.

# 4. We print the total purchase amount using the `print()` function and the `str()` function to convert the integer to a string.

# 5. We check the value of the `shipping` variable and print either "Shipping: $10" or "Shipping: Free" using the `print()` function.

# With these changes, the code should correctly calculate the total purchase amount and shipping cost based on the input and output the results to the user.
